## Welcome to the ownCloud Quickstart Guide! 

**ownCloud** is the flexible open source file synchronization and sharing solution, which runs on Linux and has client applications for Linux, Windows, and macOS, as well as mobile apps for Android and iOS. 

This Quickstart guide will help you install and configure an Owncloud 10.0.10 server and perform some common administrative tasks. We assume you are familiar with downloading, installing, and configuring Linux applications and the associated LAMP (*Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP*) stack necessary to provide a web-based service.

The guide is divided into a number of sections that will step you through a basic installation, suitable for learning how to use ownCloud, or setting it up for a small workgroup.  

- Section 1 describes [system requirements and deployment recommendations](owncloud_qs_s1.html).
- Section 2 explains [installation with the Linux Package Manager](owncloud_qs_s2.html).
- Section 3 covers [configuration of the installed system](owncloud_qs_s3.html).
- Section 4 covers some [common administrative tasks](owncloud_qs_s4.html).
- Section 5 describes how a user connects to the ownCloud server [using a desktop or mobile client](owncloud_qs_s5.html). 

To learn more about ownCloud, go to the [ownCloud Server Administration Guide](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/administration_manual/index.html), which provides comprehensive information for users who want to install, administer, and optimize their ownCloud servers.

To learn more about ownCloud as an end user, go to the [ownCloud User Manual](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/user_manual/). This provides details of the ownCloud Desktop Client, and the Android and iOS mobile apps.
