## 2 - Installation with the Linux Package Manager

The quickest and easiest way to install ownCloud on Linux is to use the Open Build Service packages (see Linux Package Manager Installation). These are maintained by ownCloud engineers, and you can use your package manager to keep your ownCloud server up-to-date.


## Manual Installation on Linux

You can setup ownCloud from scratch using a classic LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP). Go to the [Manual Installation on Linux](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html) section in the Admin Guide. This walks you through installing ownCloud on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server with Apache and MariaDB, using the ownCloud .tar archive.
